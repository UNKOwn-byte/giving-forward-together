    question: "What fees are charged on donations?",
    answer: "We charge a platform fee of 5% on successful campaigns to cover operating costs. Additionally, payment processors charge approximately 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. These fees are automatically deducted from the donations, so campaign creators receive the net amount. For charitable organizations with 501(c)(3) status, we offer a reduced platform fee of 3%.",

    question: "When do I receive the funds from my campaign?",
    answer: "For campaigns with a specific goal and end date, funds are disbursed within 7-10 business days after the campaign successfully ends. For ongoing campaigns without end dates, funds are disbursed on a monthly basis. In both cases, you must have completed our verification process and provided valid payment information to receive your funds.",

    question: "Are donations tax-deductible?",
    answer: "Donations made to campaigns run by verified 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations are tax-deductible. Donors will receive a tax receipt via email for these contributions. Donations to personal campaigns or non-registered organizations are generally not tax-deductible, as they are considered personal gifts. We recommend consulting with a tax professional for specific advice about your situation.",

You can update most information, including the description, images, and updates. However, some elements like the campaign title and funding goal may require approval before changes take effect.",

    question: "What happens if my campaign doesn't reach its goal?",
    answer: "Our platform uses a 'keep-what-you-raise' model, which means you'll receive all funds raised even if your campaign doesn't reach its target goal. This applies to all campaigns by default. However, if you prefer to only receive funds if your goal is met, you can select the 'all-or-nothing' option when creating your campaign.",
